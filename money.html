  <p> eSports players make a lot more money than most people would think. According to Business Insider, each League of Legends Championship
    player must be paid a minimum of $12,500 for one 28-game season. This is clearly a pretty decent amount of money, but some players make a
    bit more than that. Team Liquid, an eSports team with over one thousand tournaments with their players in attendance has earned over $18
    million. So, you may want to reconsider how good 10-year-old Jimmy is at Fortnite! </p>
