 <p class="rightAlign">You may be surprised to hear that Ninja and the popular music artist Drake have collaborated to bring the viewership of</p>
  <p class="rightAlign">Twitch a special treat in playing Fortnite. At one point, they broke a twitch record, having over 230,000 viewers</p>
 <p class="rightAlign">at one point, a crazy amount for anyone to have. Another interesting thing about this livestream is that Drake</p>
 <p class="rightAlign">mentioned that if the Fortnite developers were to add in a dance from a song of his to the game, he would reference the<p> 
  <p class="rightAlign">game in one of his songs.</p>
