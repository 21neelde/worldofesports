 <p class="leftAlign">Ah, Bayonetta. The best character in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. You may be thinking, why is she the best?</p>
 <p class="leftAlign">Let me list the reasons why: She has two instant dodging moves, the most powerful counter in the game, the </p>
 <p class="leftAlign">best combos in the game, the best edgeguarding in the game, and more. All of the other characters pail in comparison</p>
 <p class="leftAlign">to the amount of tools she has. But how is this affecting tournament results? </p>

 <p class="rightAlign">For this information, the community seems to do a whole lot of complaining for little statistical information.</p>
 <p class="rightAlign">This may have to do with how fun the character is to fight against, which is aggrivating to say the least.</p>
 <p class="rightAlign">This is mainly because you never know when you may lose, and it's incredibly hard to tell when it's safe to hit her.</p>
