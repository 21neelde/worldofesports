 <p class="rightAlign">You likely already know Ninja by now, but you may be unaware that he actually is making a lot more than you think.</p>
  <p class="rightAlign">Ninja makes 500 thousand dollars per year, but why? The answer is in his livestreams, where people can donate to him</p>
 <p class="rightAlign">in various ways. People are able to simply donate, subscribe and pay once a month to recieve benefits, and donate bits,</p>
 <p class="rightAlign">a newer, admittedly more confusing way to pay. Since so many people watch his livestreams, he often has crowds of people<p> 
  <p class="rightAlign">ready to donate to him.</p>
