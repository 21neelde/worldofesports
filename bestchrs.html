 <p class="rightAlign">Over the time of Super Smash Bros.' history, there have been four overpowering characters for each game that completely</p>
 <p class="rightAlign">overshadow the rest of the cast: Pikachu in Smash 64, Fox in Smash Bros. Melee, Meta Knight in Smash Bros. Brawl, and</p>
 <p class="rightAlign">Bayonetta in Smash 4. Quite a large margin of the competitive scene mainly uses these characters to give themselves</p>
 <p class="rightAlign">better results, which makes sense since the goal of the game is indeed to win. The reason these characters are so good<p> 
 <p class="rightAlign">is mainly because they have one major thing in common: speed. While obvious in Melee's Fox and not so obvious in Smash 4's</p>
 <p class="rightAlign">Bayonetta, they all use this to their advantage to overwhelm their opponent. </p>
